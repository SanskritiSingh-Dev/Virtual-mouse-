# Virtual-mouse-using-hand-gestures
Mini Project - A virtual mousing using hand gestures.

The Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures project replaces traditional input devices with a gesture-based, touchless system powered by computer vision. Using a camera and advanced algorithms, it tracks hand movements to control the cursor and perform actions like clicking and scrolling. This intuitive and hygienic technology is ideal for environments like healthcare, public spaces, and accessibility-focused applications. It enhances user interaction while reducing the need for physical contact, promoting hygiene and offering an engaging alternative to conventional devices. Though lighting and prolonged use pose challenges, its scalability and ease of customization make it a promising solution for touchless computing
